I went to various places in England last May and here is a picture of me in 
London Bridge!

I also listen to a lot of gay bops such as Troye Sivan and you can access his
latest song from here. [Got Me Started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjLcVqjIkLo)

I cloned the HW00 repository from GitHub and then opened it on VS Code. Then, 
in addition to my Python background from the coding camp with Jon Clindaniel,
I created this introduction README.md with the help of Google searches for 
different parts of the assignment. I learned that there aren't many syntax rules
for editing text compared to other computing languages such as Java.

* Headers (one or more)
* Emphasis (italics or/and bold)
* Lists
* Images: add a picture (of yourself or something else) to your repo and embed it in your README
* Links
* A summary and reflection of the Git/GitHub workflow you adopted for this homework, and of your experience with Markdown (e.g., provide a summary of the workflow you adopted, and add some comments about something new you learned, something that surprised you, etc.)
